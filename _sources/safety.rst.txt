Bears
=====

Bears have captivated many an engineer from the toddler and his Winnie the Pooh to
the more sophisticated albeit satirical Yogi and Boo-Boo. Childhood memories
aside bears can cause some roadblocks for the outdoor seeking engineer. The most
important thing regarding dealing with bears in the wild is **education**. Simply
being aware of bears and becoming familiar with their habits can go along
way in protecting one's self. Here is a great article to get you started.

There are **Black Bears** and **Grizzly Bears**. Go ahead and give the old black 
bears a warm hug and feel free to take one home as a pet! For Grizzlies lets 
just say observe at a distance. Kidding! Obviously but keeping your distance 
is a good rule of thump. If you **make noise** and let a bear know you are present
she is most likely to avoid you. Also **keep all food in bear safe locations**.
Avoid a dangerous bear encounter in the first place is key. If a situations does
arise remember the following tips.

Tips for bear encounters include:

1. Stay calm
2. Vocalize and make yourself known in a calm manner
3. Back away and leave the area slowly
4. Use bear spray to deter attacks
5. If contact is inevitable lay flat on your stomach 
   and cover your neck and head


Snakes
======

Animal Identification is important when it comes to reptiles. That way you can
tell the difference between something dangerous and something annoying. The 
following link is a great example this.

If bitten by a snake not to worry there is nothing you can do besides going to the
hospital. This may be concerning as one can feel helpless when there is nothing 
to do to improve one's situation. However, from a logical point of view there
is nothing to be done so reacting is straight forward and simple. The best advice
is to not get bit. Wear **long pants** and **be aware** in snake country.

Buffalo
=======

Here is what Yellowstone's website has to say about Bison.

    | Bison have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal. Bison
    | are unpredictable and can run three times faster than humans. Always stay 
    | at least 25 yards (23 m) away from bison.

Seems like if you use **common sense** and trust those scaredy cat like engineering
senses you will be just fine.

Communications
==============

On the job communication is key for an Engineer. However, out camping it might be
nice to cut of all contact with the outside world. This does pose a safety concern
though if something bad were to happen. A prepared Engineer is mindful of what
kind of communication is available to him.
