If bitten by a snake not to worry there is nothing you can do besides going to the
hospital. This may be concerning as one can feel helpless when there is nothing 
to do to impove one's situation. However, from a logical point of view there

is to not get bit. Wear *long pants* and *be aware* in snake country.

kind of communication is availible to him.
